# Introduction of Vectorial HVAC Simulink Model

The parameters are stored in separate matlab files, and are kept apart from the Simulink simulation, for a clear segmentation of the model.  The vectorial approach of our model combined with the easy handling of vectors by Simulink allows to tune many parameters for future experimentations.  This way, the user can modify the number of rooms, the layout of the rooms (through an adjacency matrix).  One can also use an arbitrary number of boilers, of radiators and of air-conditioning units; and decide of their disposition in the building (which unit in which room, again through a matrix).  All these choices are to be written in matlab the scripts to be load pre-simulation.  Based on component  to design Model provide an easy way to modify model as demand.

The model framework is shown as follows,

1. Physical model. In this part, we build the temperature and humidity dynamics which are influenced by outside environment , human, radiators and air conditioning. 

2. Controller. To control vectorial signal, so we use Switch block rather than StateFlow to implement the control logic. When temperature is in comfort zone, switch On boilers and radiators, otherwise close them. Note that here we seperate air conditing on/off to control humidity. User can change this module with ML component as demand.

3. Environment. It is worth noting that Environment is the stochastic part of the entire model including the outdoor environment and people influence on temperature which the number of people is parameterized. The temperature of a day varies within an interval and follows a normal distribution. The distribution of people in room change randomly per hour.

4. Elvauations. This part is for online verification about HVAC system. In this paper we use three online monitor tools here to compare their efficiency and accuracy.

   There are all the model setting files and model files in HVAC model folder.

There are two folders for the two experiments based on HVAC model.

The model with different online monitors  is the same in both folder, with the exception of the verification module that changes based on the experiment at hand.

- "fulltest.m" files are the launching scripts
- the "*.slx" files are the simulink models"
- the other files are for loading or defining the parameters.
